# About StreeVenders

- A platform connecting women-owned local stores with shoppers looking to support small businesses in their community.

- The goal of this project is to increase the representation and success of women entrepreneurs in the business world.

# Technologies Used

- To create the Frontend, we used React.js & some of its libraries like React-Router, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

- For the Backend, we used the services of Appwrite for authentication of the users.

- We have also used Alan AI Api for implementing voice recognition features 

# How it Works
- The user is introduced to the landing page as soon as he/she opens the website, where we highlight our motive, the issues which woman are facing, followed by the solutions given by us. All this frontend part is developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

- To add your shop on our website, you can click the join us button and can be a part of this entrepreneurship ecosystem. They will be soon redirected to a Login/Signup Page, once Logged In, they can choose the type of shop they want to put on the website, and can fill some basic information through the form.
- Once done, thier shop would be listed on the StreeVendors website.
